# NoviaChat: 14‑Day SEO Execution Checklist (Hard Truth)

Goal: move from “we have a plan” → “we shipped the ranking prerequisites” for:
- `novia virtual`
- `novia virtual gratis`
- `chicas ia`
- `chica virtual`

Non‑negotiable truth: you do **not** get #1 on these head terms without (1) clean technical signals, (2) intent-matching pages, and (3) a real link/authority ramp. If you skip (3), expect a ceiling.

## Day 0 (2–3 hours): baseline you can’t fake later
- [ ] Google Search Console: export queries/pages for the 4 terms by country (MX/ES/AR/CO/US).
- [ ] Index coverage: screenshot counts for “Duplicate, Google chose different canonical”, “Alternate page with proper canonical”.
- [ ] Crawl (any crawler): export indexable URLs + titles + canonicals + status codes.
- [ ] CWV baseline: Lighthouse mobile for `/`, `/novia-virtual`, `/girls`, `/plans`.
- [ ] Authority baseline: current referring domains + top linked pages + anchor distribution.

Deliverable: a single folder with exports + screenshots + dates.

## Week 1: fix signals + ship the missing money page

### Day 1: canonical host + sitemap/robots sanity
- [ ] Pick one canonical host (`www` or non‑`www`) and make **everything** match it: `metadataBase`, canonicals, Open Graph URLs, sitemap URLs, robots sitemap URL.
- [ ] Enforce a permanent redirect (308/301) from the non‑canonical host → canonical host.
- [ ] Ensure sitemap only lists pages you actually want indexed.
- [ ] Make sitemap `lastmod` stable (don’t “update everything daily” unless content changes).

### Day 2: indexing hygiene (prevent index bloat)
- [ ] Add `noindex` (preferably via `X‑Robots‑Tag`) for: `/chat/*`, `/account/*`, `/checkout/*`, auth pages (`/signin`, `/reset-password`), and admin.
- [ ] Confirm you are not leaking infinite/duplicate URLs (filters, params, dynamic pages).

### Days 3–4: ship `/chicas-ia` (server rendered, text‑rich)
- [ ] One page, one intent: explain “chicas IA” + show the product + CTA “Empieza gratis”.
- [ ] Add FAQs based on real questions (GSC + People Also Ask) and include FAQ schema **only if the FAQ is visible on-page**.
- [ ] Include trust blocks: privacy stance, “AI, not real people”, pricing clarity (“gratis para probar” vs premium).
- [ ] Internal links: `/girls`, `/novia-virtual`, `/plans`, `/signin`.
- [ ] Add it to the sitemap.

### Day 5: internal linking pass (quick win)
- [ ] Add 5–10 contextual links from high-traffic pages to the 4 target URLs (avoid exact-match spam anchors).
- [ ] Add breadcrumbs where it makes sense (and optionally breadcrumb schema).

### Days 6–7: SERP reality check + page brief upgrades
- [ ] For each query in MX/ES/AR: log top 10 results, intent, content blocks, trust signals, and link strength.
- [ ] Write a 1‑page brief for each primary URL: H1, sections, FAQs, media, CTA, internal links.

## Week 2: build topical depth + start earning links

### Content (ship 3–5 supporting pages)
- [ ] `/como-funciona` (how it works, memory/personalization, safety)
- [ ] `/prueba-gratis` (what “gratis” actually includes, limits, upgrade triggers)
- [ ] `/privacidad` + `/terminos` (real pages, real content; don’t handwave)
- [ ] Optional: `/seguridad` or `/borrar-cuenta` (trust and churn reduction)

Rule: each supporting page links to **exactly one** primary target URL with a natural, descriptive anchor.

### Authority (minimum viable outreach)
- [ ] Submit to 10–20 legitimate “AI tools / chatbot” directories (avoid spam farms).
- [ ] Pitch 10 creators/sites that already talk about AI companions (affiliate or collab).
- [ ] Build 1 linkable asset (demo, benchmark, small report) that deserves citations.

Hard truth: if you’re not consistently getting new quality referring domains, the “rank #1” goal is a fantasy. Track outreach like a sales pipeline.

## Weekly scorecard (don’t guess)
- [ ] Query → page mapping for the 4 terms (GSC): impressions, clicks, CTR, avg position, country split.
- [ ] Index coverage: duplicates/canonicals.
- [ ] Referring domains gained (quality > quantity).
- [ ] Organic → signup and signup → premium conversion rate per landing page.
